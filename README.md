# EasyMealPlanner Application

This is a portfolio application used to showcase my skill in React, Styled Components, TypeScript, Next.js and Redux.

Easy Meal Planner lets users create an account, create recipes, save recipes, and
create a meal plan for their week.

The deployed application can be found at the following URL, [https://easymealplanners.com](https://easymealplanners.com).

## Description of App Features

The features implemented accomplish the goal of making the Minimum Viable Product of a meal planning application.

You can sign in as a demo user so that you can quickly navigate the site and view its features.

Once you are successfully authenticated with a JSON Web Token, you have the pages for creating a recipe, viewing recipes, and creating a meal plan.

You can also view details about a recipe and modify the serving size.

## Skills Learned

The skills I demonstrate in this project include the following.

- Utilize Redux as single source of truth to reduce prop drilling
- Implement styled components for organized and reusable CSS styles
- Develop asynchronous JavaScript with React Hooks to make request to a Web API built in Java and Spring Boot
- Created controlled components for login, register, and create recipe pages
- Implement action creators, actions, reducers, and selectors for interacting with Redux Store
- Use Next.js for page routing
